# AES encryption

[Advanced Encryption Standard](aes) (AES) is a symmetric-key algorithm and is a variant of the Rijndael (pronounced 'rain-dull') block cipher. AES supersedes the [Data Encryption Standard](des) (DES).

AES supports a block size of 128 bits, and three different key lengths: 128, 192, and 256 bits.

Unlike DES, it does not use a Feistel network, and most AES calculations are done in a particular finite field.
